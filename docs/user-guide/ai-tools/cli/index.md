# CFSAI Command-Line Utility

The CFSAI command-line utility (`cfsai`) allows you to compile and analyze AI models for Analog Devices’ embedded targets directly from the command line. It supports building deployable code and running advanced analysis tools to check model compatibility and profile resource usage before deployment.

- [Overview](./cfsai.md) — Learn how to access CFSAI.  
- [Build](./cfsai-build.md) — Build deployable C/C++ code from models using `.cfsconfig` files or command-line flags.  
- [Reports](./cfsai-report.md) — Generate reports to check model compatibility (supported operators, data types, and memory constraints) and analyze performance (memory usage, compute load, accelerator utilization, power and latency estimates).
- [Utility commands](./cfsai-utility.md) — List targets, backends, extensions, and clean cached artifacts.
