# AI Tools

Neural Networks are a powerful machine learning tool that can yield great results for pattern detection and signal processing. CodeFusion Studio provides support to make it easier to deploy and evaluate Neural Network models in your embedded applications.

- [Supported processors and model formats](supported-ai-model-formats.md): Learn which AI model formats are supported for each SoC.
- [Embedded AI Tools in System Planner](../tools/config-tool/manage-ai-models.md): Create model configurations from supported AI model files, generate deployable C/C++ code, and optionally run compatibility and profiling reports for guidance.
- [AI Profiling in System Planner](../tools/config-tool/profiling.md): Perform inference-level profiling for TFLM models to analyze AI workloads in detail.
- [CFSAI Command Line Utility](./cli/index.md): Create model configurations, generate deployable C/C++ code, and optionally run compatibility and profiling reports — all from the terminal.
- [Compatibility analyzer report](compat-report.md): Review memory constraints, operator issues, and data type compatibility.
- [Resource profiling report](profiling-report.md): Examine resource usage summaries and identify optimization opportunities.
