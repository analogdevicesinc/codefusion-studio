## About this release

CodeFusion Studio 1.0.2 is a patch release to fix a critical bug related to [VS Code 1.98 (February 2025)](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_98).

CodeFusion Studio 1.0.0 does not work correctly with VS Code 1.98+ due to a change in Node.js, which breaks webview-based features, including:

- ELF File Explorer
- Config Tools (Pin Mux, Clock Config)

Upgrade to CodeFusion Studio 1.0.2 to resolve this issue. If upgrading is not immediately possible, use [VS Code 1.97.2](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_97).
