# Package Manager

You can use the Package Manager to install updates, add new SDKs, or manage plugins and toolchains as they become available, with no need to perform a full installation.

Each component is delivered as a package — a versioned unit that can be downloaded on demand from a remote server. This means you don’t need to rerun the full installer when updates are released. Instead, you can keep your environment up to date by installing only the packages you need, when you need them.

For details on managing packages, refer to the following articles:
