# Core Dump Analysis Tool overview

The Core Dump Analysis Tool enables developers to inspect the state of Zephyr-based firmware for supported SoCs at the time of a crash. It supports post-mortem debugging using core dumps generated by Zephyr-based applications.

## Supported processors

Core dump analysis supports Zephyr RTOS applications on the following SoCs:

- MAX32657
- MAX32690

Support extends to all processor cores included in these SoCs.

## Platform support

On macOS, the GDB binary used for Core Dump Analysis is not Python-enabled by default. For setup instructions, see the [Release Notes](../../../../release-notes/2.0.0.md#debug-and-analysis-tools).
